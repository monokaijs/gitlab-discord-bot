# GitLab Discord Bot
A simple bot made deployment & issue tracking more visible.

### Introduction
Yeah, I'm tired navigating between projects tracing issues state. I made this bot, so I can easily
manage GitLab projects' deployments and issues in a single Discord server.

### How does it work?
It simply runs a web-server under-the-hood and bind web-url onto your gitlab project as a webhook.

### Installation
Clone project and install dependencies:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/monokaijs/gitlab-discord-bot.git
cd gitlab-discord-bot/
yarn install
```

Then do stuffs...
